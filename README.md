# üåç World Life Expectancy Project

## üìå Overview
This project focuses on **cleaning and analyzing global life expectancy data** using **MySQL**. The dataset contains information on life expectancy, GDP, BMI, and adult mortality for various countries over multiple years. The project involves preparing the data for analysis by resolving inconsistencies, removing duplicates, handling missing values, and exploring key trends and relationships between life expectancy and socioeconomic factors.

## üõ† Tools and Technologies
- **Database Management**: MySQL
- **Dataset**: Global life expectancy data, sourced from public repositories like WHO or World Bank.

## üìä Project Phases

### 1. **Data Cleaning**
- **Duplicate Removal**:
  - Identified and removed redundant records based on country and year combinations.
- **Handling Missing Values**:
  - Imputed missing values for critical fields such as `Life Expectancy` and `Status` using logical methods (e.g., averaging neighboring years, country-specific data trends).
- **Data Standardization**:
  - Ensured consistency in formatting and resolved anomalies in fields like `Country` and `Status`.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- **Life Expectancy Trends**:
  - Analyzed changes in life expectancy over time and across countries.
  - Highlighted improvements in developing nations over the past 15 years.
- **GDP and Life Expectancy**:
  - Identified a strong correlation between GDP and life expectancy, with higher GDP generally associated with better longevity.
- **Regional Insights**:
  - Compared average life expectancy across developed and developing countries.
- **Other Factor Relationships**:
  - Explored how BMI and adult mortality relate to life expectancy trends globally.

## üìà Key Findings
1. **Significant Life Expectancy Improvements**:
   - Developing countries showed notable progress in life expectancy over the last decade.
2. **Economic Prosperity Matters**:
   - Higher GDP per capita correlates with longer life expectancy, emphasizing the impact of economic stability.
3. **Health and Longevity**:
   - Countries with better access to healthcare (measured through BMI and adult mortality) tend to have higher life expectancy rates.
4. **Status-Based Variations**:
   - Developed countries generally outperform developing nations in life expectancy averages.
